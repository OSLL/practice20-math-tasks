    For all modes and difficulties your target is to make correct mathematical expression.
    \n\n
    For all difficulties in mode "Place digits" you can use
    digits:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and only one time!!!\n
    And also from digits you can make numbers,but solution which use only digits(without numbers) exists!!!
    \n\n


    Difficulty:\n
    #1."I\'m too young to die" - it is the easiest difficulty. Here you
    can use only +(add), -(subtract), *(multiply) and digits:1,2,3,4,5,
    6,7,8,9. Also it contains no more than 4 operations.\n
    #2."Hurt me plenty" - not so hard and not so easy.This difficulty is
    similar to first but contains between 4 and 7 operations.\n
    #3"Nightmare!!!" - is the hardest difficulty. It is similar to first and second
    difficulties but in addition contains operations |(logical or), &amp;(logical and), ^(xor),%(returns remainder of the division)
    (Read about it on Wiki, if you don\'t know those operations) and from 7 to 9 operations.
    \n\n

    1."Place digits" - you need to place digits between operations.\n
